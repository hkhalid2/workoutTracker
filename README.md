# workoutTracker
## Description
The main motivation for creating this project was to create offline functionality and access for this Budget Tracker app. This application is used primiarily as a budget Tracker for the user which keeps track of money gains and losses over time. Offline and online deposits and expenses are both kept track of in the app. Said app is deployed on heroku and uses MongoDB to store and display data.

The main problems this app solves include:
* Displaying offline and online deposits/expenses on app by utilizing the browsers cache.
* Creating a live webpage using Heroku that utilizes MongoDB to host the stored data.

Overall this project helped me to understand how browser cache interacts with applications and also helped me to gain more exposure to MongoDB and how to deploy an application using it.
