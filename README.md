# workoutTracker
## Description
The main motivation for creating this project was to add backend Database Functionality to a workout tracker app. The Frontend app was already given but the back end required models and routes executed using MongoDB to achieve full functionality of the app. With full functionality this app allows the user to store and view previous workouts/exercises over time. 

The main problems this app solves include:
* Creating a backend MongoDB database for storing various workouts
* Creating a live webpage using Heroku that utilizes MongoDB to host the stored data.

Overall this project helped me to understand how to create model and routes using MongoDB and its associated packages while also gaining more familiarity with deployment on Heroku using AtlasDB.
